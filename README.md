An age calculator is a tool or application that helps determine a person's age based on their date of birth. It calculates the exact age in years, months, and days, taking into account the current date. This tool is commonly used to:

Determine Exact Age: It calculates how old someone is today, whether in full years, months, or days.
Birthday Countdown: It can help you know how much time is left until someone's next birthday.
Historical Comparisons: You can also compare ages at different points in time, such as how old a person was on a specific date in the past or future.
Age calculators are useful for a wide range of applications, including determining eligibility for certain age-based services (like legal rights, discounts, or age-specific activities) or for personal milestones.
